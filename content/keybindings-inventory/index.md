## Keybindings Inventory

When designing a custom mechanical keyboard keymap, it is helpful to have a full inventory of all bindings that you want to use. This is an attempt to formulate such an inventory for my own use.

My biases:

- macOS over Windows or Linux
- ubuiquitous vim-like bindings
- attempt to avoid remapping default bindings

### Basic Keys

#### Essentials

- alphas
- symbols
- numbers
- modifiers
  - command/win/gui

  - home
  - end
  - arrow keys

#### Supplemental
